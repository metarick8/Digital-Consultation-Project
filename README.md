# My first project in Laravel

This project is my very first project that i did using Laravel framework
Back then the authentication, and mutli guard were really hard for me to apply but i did it at the end, the project has some mistakes due to that i wasn't really understanding realtionships and how data is being stored there
The project is 3 years old but i didn't know that much about git that time so i just created a repository and thought it will do the magic alone

# Digital consultant app

It's an application where we have 2 actors:
An expert, who is categorized and can share there available working time each day and hour, and the price for their sessions
and a user who can book an appointement with the expert's free time only if that picked time wasn't booked by any other user, and got enough money in their budget to pay for the session
a user can rate experts, and add them to a favorite list so they can find them easily
